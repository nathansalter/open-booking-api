Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api/issues) and
pull requests. The source code is available

# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard
data models ([[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and
harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]).

This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to
be active. This specification builds on that work by defining an HTTP API that
can be implemented by booking systems that are publishing opportunity data. By
allowing third-party applications to place bookings in their systems, it becomes
 possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and
 sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
booking system (server) and the third-party application (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter.

## Scope and requirements

The current scope of the specification should conform to a set of
[use cases and requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsCr071V12i_2g0DK818OAGlEAJFLWwkBp9bpgx4fo8/edit?usp=sharing)
that have previously been identified and discussed with the OpenActive
community.

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest
use cases that will support making bookings on behalf of users. This core
functionality includes:

* __Pricing and availability__ – checking the price and current availabilty of
an event or for the use of a facility
* __Leasing__ – temporarily reserving spaces for a user to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst placing a booking
* __Booking__ – placing and viewing bookings, and where necessary, confirming
receipt of payment from users

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and
facilities are currently out of scope:

* creating and managing accounts for users
* more complex pricing options, e.g. membership based pricing
* handling bookings for multiple events ("shopping carts") or for groups of users
* waiting lists for events

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community.

### Functionality that is out of scope

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive Community Group.

The functionality that is currrently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ – while the specification recommends some
best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a
specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system
that offers the best security for their platform and users
* __Payment processing__ – the design assumes that all payment handling will
be carried out by the third-party application, in a separate payment flow.
Booking systems and application developers are able to use the payment and
reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their customers
* __API business models__ – the design is agnostic to any business models that
might govern the use of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing
fees
* __Discovery__  – finding, filtering and searching for opportunity data. This
specification assumes that the client and server applications have already
shared data about the relevant opportunities. Additional functionality in this
area will be addressed by future specifications from the Community Group

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

* Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a booking
system
* Software developers building client libraries or applications that will use
the API

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Booking Flow

## High-level summary of the API

This API defines a means for a **booking system** to expose an HTTP API that
may be used by a **broker** to place bookings for **opportunities** on behalf of
a **customer**. By exposing this API the booking system can support a **seller**
in reaching a wider audience.

A **broker** provides **customers** with an application that helps them to discover
**opportunities** to be physically active. The customer may then choose to make
a booking to attend an **event** or to make use of a **facility**.

The **broker** will check the availability of the **opportunity** in order to check
whether the **customer** can still attend. The **broker** will also present the
**customer** with information about any costs associated with taking up the
**opportunity**. This involves identifying the applicable **offers** and
presenting them to the user. The customer should be made aware of any terms and
conditions and any restrictions relating to age, gender or ability, as part of
the process of proceeding to being in a position to make a booking.

If there is still availability and the **customer** is happy to accept an
**offer**, then the **customer** can proceed to make a booking. The broker
creates an **order** on behalf of the user.

Creating the **order** will also create a temporary **lease** that will reserve
a space for the **customer** to take up the **opportunity** while the
rest of the workflow completes.

If the **offers** for an event or use of a facility indicate that the user must
pay, then the broker will take the customer through a separate **payment**
workflow. This workflow is not defined by this specification.

Once **payment** has been completed, the **broker** will update the
**booking platform** to indicate that **payment** has been taken. The
**booking** process is then completed and the **order** is maked as completed.

The completion of the **order** will result in the **lease** being removed and a
permanent **reservation** being created on behalf of the **customer**. The
**customer** may receive **confirmation** from either the **broker** or
**booking system** (or both) that provides details about how and when they can
attend the **event** or use the booked **facility**.

Separately the **broker** and **booking system** will go through a
**reconciliation** process to transfer funds or otherwise report on successful
transactions. A **customer** might also cancel an **order** and will then
receive a **refund**. The reconciliation processes is not defined by this
specification. The details will depend on the business model and agreements in
place between the **broker** and **booking system**. The cancellation workflow
is defined in this specification in terms of the steps that the **broker** must
undertake to provide the **booking system** with notification of the
cancellation.

## URLs used in the description of the API

The following sections contain URIs which are for guidance, and are used as
examples only. For example, /events/452 is used to represent the canonical
reference to the web representation of an Event with an id of 452. The URI could
alternatively be /sessions/452 if session is the term used to describe the
specific type of Event by a particular seller or booking system or by /slots/452
if dealing with a **slot** for use of a **facility**. All URIs should
however be long lived identifiers and canonical and should not be recycled.
Adherence to the workflows within this specification is required to develop a
compliant **booking system**/**broker** implementation of this API and
associated APIs such as RDPE in the Open Active ecosystem.

    </figure>

## Step-by-step process description

The 1.0, and higher, versions of the Booking API supports single items per **order** and
single **payments** per **order**. Future versions of the specification may support
multiple items and multipart **payments** which are out of scope for the 1.0 release.

### Complete transaction

1. The **broker** requests details on a specific **opportunity** from the
**booking system** (/events/452 in example) in order to discover available
**offers**. These offers are subsequently presented to the **customer**.
2. The **customer** chooses an bookable **offer** (see definition of a bookable
event).
3. If the **offer** for the **opportunity** is bookable, the broker makes a POST
request to the **orders** endpoint (/orders in the examples) containing a
Person object describing the **customer**, and information about the **offer**
and **opportunity** selected. At a minimum, this Person object should
contain the `email` address for the **customer**, and if possible the `givenName`
and `familyName`. The **booking system** creates a timed **lease** on the space
in the **opportunity** which is being booked. At this point the **offer** is
deemed to be accepted and an **order** is created.
The **booking system** sends a 201
status code, with a representation of the **order** in the body of the response,
and with a Location header set containing the URI for the web representation of
the created **Order** object.
4. If there is a price for the **offer**, the **broker** takes payment from the
**customer** via a third party payment provider.
5. The **broker** notifies the **seller** of the payment by making a PATCH
request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the example) of the
**booking system**. This should include details of the `paymentMethod` and the
`paymentMethodId` (commonly the last four digits of the card which can be used
by the **seller** to identify the **customer**). The **broker** should store any
details about the transaction which are needed for processing refunds or in the
case of chargebacks. This is out of scope for the Booking API spec and is the
responsibility of the **broker**.
6. The **booking system** notifies the **broker** of a successful order
completion by returning a response with a 200 status code and an object with an
appropriate value for the `confirmationCode` field.

The **broker** is the entity initiating **payment** and as the merchant in the
transaction is responsible for storing records of the **payment** transaction
such as authorization codes. This is an implementation detail and is thus,
out of scope for the Booking API and specification.


### Cancelling a Lease

If the **customer** no longer wants to proceed with a particular **offer**, the
lease for the space in the **opportunity** and the **order** may be cancelled by
issuing a DELETE request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the
example) of the **booking system**.

The **booking system** SHOULD release the space in the **event** and delete the
underlying resource. Any subsequent requests to this resource should result in a
404 response.

### Handling lease expiry

If the lease has expired during the **payment** process, the **broker** SHOULD
check whether the **opportunity** is still bookable and if the selected
**offer** is still available. If they are, the **broker** should create a
new **order** using the workflow described above.

The **booking system** should respond to requests for **orders** with an expired
lease with a 410 status code with an error specifying the `errorType` as
https://openactive.io/errors/anonymous_lease_expired until the underlying
**order** resource is removed.

## Order cancellation and refunds

Since the **broker** is the party which initiates the third-party **payment**
and is the entity which notifies the **booking system** of **payment** and
creates the **order** on behalf of the **customer**, the **broker** is also the
entity which handles refunds and cancellation. It should be noted that not all
opportunities/offers are cancellable by the customer.

There are two distinct types of cancellation:

- **customer** originated cancellation
- **booking system** originated cancellation

These two different types of cancellation have very different workflows which
are outlined below.

### Customer originated cancellation

The workflow to deal with the cancellation and refund of an order by the **customer**
is described below. For clarity, it is assumed that the order being cancelled
may be cancelled (see section around Cancellable offers/opportunities).

1. The **broker** intiates a refund for the **customer** using the mechanisms
provided by the third-party payment provider.

2. The **broker** notifies the **booking system** of the cancellation by making
a PATCH request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the example) of
the **booking system**. The PATCH request body should contain an updated
order item in the `orderedItem` property, with the `orderItemStatus` set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled to indicate that the ordered item in
the **order** is no longer required.

3. The **booking system** responds to the **broker** with a representation of
the **order** with the `orderStatus` property set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled with a status of 200. The **order** is now
deemed to be cancelled.

### Booking system originated cancellation

The workflow to deal with the cancellation and refund of an order by the **booking
system** is described below. Only the **booking system** can cancel  **orders**
relating to **opportunities** and **offers** which are not otherwise cancellable.

This is to be used in situations where the underlying **opportunity**/**offer**
needs to be cancelled, thus necessitating the cancellation of a **customer's**
order.

The mechanism for the **booking system** to notify the **broker** that an
**order** is cancelled is through a webhook, where the **booking
system** POSTs data relating to the orders which are cancelled to the
**broker**. The **booking system** MUST only POST **orders** to a **broker**
which have been initiated by that **broker**. No **customer** details should be
transmitted in the POST to the webhook.

The process of registering webhooks by the **broker** with the **booking system**
is out of scope for this specification. One possible addition in a later version
of the Booking API specification is the extension of this mechanism to cover
opportunities that are rescheduled.

1. The POST sent by the **booking system** to the webhook receiver of the **broker**
should contain an array of cancelled **orders**.

2. The **broker** parses the array of cancelled orders and matches them to existing
**orders** from **customers**.

3. The **broker** refunds the customer and alerts them to the cancellation. It
is good practice for the **booking system** to also notify the **customer** of
the cancellation, where they can potentially provide more information about
the rescheduling of the event.

4. The **broker** then cancels the order as described in step 2 of the previous
session by making a PATCH request to the CancelAction.

### Definition of a 'cancellable' oppportunity/offer

In order to provide an excellent user experience for the **customer**, the
**booking system** MUST provide information in it's terms of service about its
cancellation policy. To avoid disappointment by the **customer**, **booking systems**
MUST also make it clear prior to entering the booking workflow, whether specific
opportunities and offers are cancellable, and if required, what the cancellation
window is. The **broker** must always display information relating to whether the
**opportunity**/**offer** is cancellable and what the cancellation window is,
before the user has created an order.

For an opportunity/offer to be cancellable it MUST:

- contain an `isCancellable` boolean property set to 'true'

If the opportunity or offer contains a `cancellationValidUntil` datetime property,
it MUST NOT have already been exceeded.

Different offers can potentially have different cancellation windows, or alternatively
some offers may be cancellable, yet other offers on the same opportunity may
not be cancellable. The data has been modelled to allow flexibility in business
models for the **booking system** and the **seller**.

Cancellable opportunities/offers will result in **orders** which contain a `CancelAction`
in their `potentialAction` property.

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Media types


Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive.

**Booking platforms** MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types will conform to the following pattern:

```
application/vnd.openactive[.version]+json
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive.1.0+json
```

**Brokers** specifying a media type without a version, such as:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json
```

will recieve data in in the most current format which is 1.0.

If you are building an application as a **broker** and care about the stability
of the response, or have a client application which is tied to a specific
version you should always try to use a media type containing the version number.

**Booking systems** are not obliged to support previous versions of the
specification, and so may not support a specific version number. We anticipate
that when the Booking API reaches the stability of a 1.0 version that this
advice may change.


## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents.

The documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers to the
[[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.

## URL discovery

The Booking API has been defined around the concept of URL discovery. This
allows **booking systems** to create resource URLs which match their own
terms for naming specific objects such as **events** and **orders**.

The URL for a specific action, such as for example providing **payment** details,
may be discovered by parsing the actions defined in the `potentialAction`
property of an object and constructing the appropriate URL from the
`urlTemplate` property of the `schema:EntryPoint` object contained within the `target`
property of the `potentialAction` required.

An example is below:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a potentialAction">

"potentialAction": [
        {
          "type": "PayAction",
          "name": "Payment",
          "target": {
            "type": "EntryPoint",
            "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/orders",
            "encodingType": "application/vnd.openactive.v1.0+json",
            "httpMethod": "PATCH"
          }
        }
      ]
</pre>

Since discovery of URLs is an implicit part of the specification, **brokers**
SHOULD avoid hard-coding URLs for specific actions into their applications and
client libraries. **Brokers**  SHOULD use most applicable URL discovered at the
point in the workflow they are currently in - e.g. not use a cached URL that has
been previously successfully used. They should also not attempt to create URLs
for a specific action based on patterns within previously used URLs.

It is the responsibility of **booking platforms** to advertise the URL for
further activity in the booking workflow at the point of need. For example they
MUST advertise the URL for **order** creation when a **broker** requests
a specific **opportunity** resource and SHOULD advertise it in their RDPE feeds
since both of these points within the booking workflow are places where a \
**customer** may wish to check availability.


## Error handling

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP
5XX status code.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format using a
content type of `application/vnd.openactive.v1.0+json` and include at least one
Error object. The error handling has in the Booking API has been modelled
closely on [[!RFC7807]].

<pre class="example" title="Error response format">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Error",
  "errorType": "https://openactive.io/errors/incomplete_customer_details",
  "title": "Incomplete customer details",
  "details": "No customer details supplied",
  "status": 400,
  "instance": "/orders",
  "method": "POST"
}
</pre>

* `errorType` – a URI reference [[!RFC3986]] that identifies the problem type. This
specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide human-readable
documentation for the problem type.
When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be "about:blank".
* `title` – a short, human-readable summary of the problem type. It
SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
purposes of localization.
* `description` – a slightly longer, human-readable summary of the problem type.
It largely SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem,
except for purposes of localization or to provide specific information about why
the error occurred in that particular case.
* `status`  – the HTTP status code ([[!RFC7231]], Section 6) generated by the
origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
* `instance`  – a URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
the problem. It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
* `requestId`  – used by technical support for diagnostics purposes.

## Security

All HTTP requests and responses SHOULD be secured using SSL.

## Authentication

### API level authentication

All of the API transactions described in this document SHOULD require
authentication.

This standard does not mandate a particular authentication method, but
recommendation is that implementers SHOULD consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is
well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different
application flows (e.g. via a Javascript web application or between servers).

Other server to server authentication mechanisms such as basic authentication,
API key or bearer tokern based mechanisms are also appropriate.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that **orders**
created by a specific **broker** SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other
**broker**. It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that
subsequent requests to an **order** should only be initiated by the **broker**
which created the **order**.

### Customer level authentication

Where necessary, OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) provides a standard
way of verifying the identity of customer. It is a thin layer that sits
atop OAuth2.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that **orders**
created by a specific **customer** SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other
**customer**. It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that
subsequent requests to an **order** should only be initiated by the **customer**
which created the **order**.


## Delivery of terms and conditions

The **broker** should make the **customer** aware of and assent to any specific
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy for using their service at the point of
a **customer** signing up to the service and/or providing their contact details.

Since, during **booking**, the details of the **customer** are provided to the
**booking system** and the **seller**, the **broker** should inform the
**customer** of this any implications with resepct to GDPR and any other
data protection legislation.

Any specific Terms and Conditions for the **offer** being taken, or Terms and
Conditions relating to the **seller** should be made available via a URL as a
`termsOfService` property on the **offer**. (https://pending.schema.org/termsOfService)



    </section>

    <section class="normative">
# Operations

## Checking availability and offers

This specification assumes that a *broker* has already obtained opportunity
data from a *booking system* that includes descriptions of **events**,
**facilities**, **slots** etc. For example by harvesting data via an [[RPDE]]
feed.

The availability of an **event**, or `subEvent`, or **facility** (either as a
`FacilityUse` or `Slot`) may change at any time.

The **offers** available to a customer might also change over time and the data
should be refreshed so that the most up-to-date representation of the live data
is presented to the **purchaser** before booking.

A **booking system**  MUST allow a **broker** to check the current state of
**events** and/or **facilities** depending on what decide they expose from their
platform.

### Definition of a 'bookable' Event

An **event** is deemed to be 'bookable' if:

- The **event** has not already occurred, i.e. the `startDate` (when expressed
as a timedatestamp) and the `endDate` of the **event** has not been exceeded

- The `eventStatus` of the **event** does not indicate that it has been
cancelled or postponed

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of the **event** is greater than the number
of places required

- The `potentialAction` of the **event** contains one or more appropriate
ReserveAction objects

- There are one or more valid bookable **offers** for the **event**

- The temporary lease on the space in the **event** (defined in
`orderLeaseDuration`) has not expired before the **payment** is taken
by the **broker** and the **seller** is notified by the **broker** that payment
has taken place.

The **customer** may be ineligible to attend a 'bookable' **event**, but may
book a space for someone else (e.g. a child) if:

- The gender of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with
the `genderRestriction` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

- The age of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with the
`ageRange` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

The **event** may also be deemed to be bookable if the **event** contains a deep
link to a URL where the user can book the **event** independently, however
this is out of scope for this API

The above set of restrictions are at the level of the **event** and the data
contained within the content of the API returns.

On a **booking system** level, an **event** is 'bookable', mediated by a
specific **broker**, if that **broker** has machine readable permission to
access the relevant instance of the Booking API provided by the **booking**
system via an API key or similar token.

For the purposes of this specification, the **event** is only bookable if the
data describing the the **event** is published via a **booking system** which
is compliant with and supports the Open Active Booking API.


### Definition of a 'bookable' slot/facility use

A slot is essentially an event, and many of the above conditions apply, however
some of the properties for a slot are different and as a consequence there are
different criteria for it being bookable.

A **slot** is deemed to be 'bookable' if:

- The **slot** has not already occurred, i.e. the `startDate` (when expressed
as a timedatestamp) and `endDate` of the **slot** has not been exceeded

- The `remainingUses` of the **slot** is greater than or equal to the number
of slots required. For example if an independently organised badminton league
requires four courts, the number of `remainingUses` should be 4 or higher.

- There are one or more valid **offers** for the slot

- The `potentialAction` of the **slot** contains one or more appropriate
ReserveAction objects

There may be more restrictions placed by a **seller** on the booking of a
**slot** for use of a **facility**. For example, it may be that one of the party
must be over a certain age as a supervising adult if some of the party are
minors. It is the responsibility of the **booking platform** to make the terms
and conditions of **booking** available to the **broker** and it is the
responsibility of the **broker** to ensure that the **customer** is aware of
these conditions before entering the **order** workflow.

### Checking availability and offers for an event or facility use slot

To check the availability of an opportunity a **broker** will issue a GET
request to the URI specified in the `id` of the opportunity, having
discovered it from the RDPE feed.

It is the responsibility of **brokers** to ensure that spaces within the
opportunity are still available before proceeding with booking.

### Assembling a set of offers and presenting them to a customer

The **broker** MUST assemble a set of all applicable **offers** for an
**opportunity** from the information supplied by the **booking system**.
An applicable **offer** is an **offer** which is available for an
**opportunity** which is bookable and for which the **customer** is eligible.

#### Collating offers for an event

In the case of the **event** having no `subEvent` the set of all applicable
**offers** is simply the array of **offers** contained within the `offers`
property.

In the case of an **event** containing sub-events within the `subEvent` property
the set of all applicable offers should be compiled from the **offers** from the
sub-event selected by the customer, augmented with any additional different
offers contained in the parent super-event.

If the sub-event selected by the **customer** has no **offers** the set of all
applicable offers will be compiled from the **offers** contained withinin the
super-event.

The **broker** should then filter this set to provide a set of current **offers**
which apply to the **customer**. This specification provides no guidance as to
how the filtering should be performed.

The **broker** SHOULD however show all applicable **offers** to a customer,
including information on pricing restrictions, unless the **customer** has only
requested a subset in some form of preferences (e.g. only show adult classes
and offers).

The **customer** selects one of these **offers** and when all pre-conditions
have been met, the **broker** enters the **order** creation workflow on behalf
of the customer.

#### Collating offers for the use of a facility

The process for building a set of all applicable offers is similar for
**facilities** with the **offers** which are part of a specific **slot** having
primacy over the more generic **offers** contained within a`FacilityUse`.

The **booking system** MUST ensure that the data presented to the **broker** in
the `remainingUses` property  in the **slot** is up to date and includes a
combination of places already booked and places currently reserved by leases
from in-progress **orders**. The **booking system** MUST also ensure that
the `hoursAvailable` property on the `FacilityUse` is kept updated.


### Obtaining a lease on a space within an opportunity

**Orders** SHOULD contain a `orderLeaseDuration` property. This
property MUST contain an ISO 8601 formatted duration for the lease. The lease
duration may also be advertised somewhere else to make it clear in advance,
e.g. in docs/setup config, or as part of a `potentialAction` property.

(Note: In previous iterations of the Booking API specification, the lease was
a property of an event. This has now been deprecated.)

The `orderLeaseDuration` property notifies the **broker** about the
length of time for which a space will be reserved by the **booking system**
whilst payment for the **event** is taken by the third-party payment system.

The default suggested lease duration is 15 minutes, but it is up to each
**booking plaftorm** to define and advertise their own lease duration.

This lease is NOT designed as a pause for a shopping cart system (in addition
shopping cart functionality is out of scope for v1.0 of this specification).

The **broker** MUST ensure that it has obtained all of the relevant details
about a **customer** before getting to the point where it attempts to place an
**order**. The lease is not designed as a pause in the process whilst a
**customer** is registered by a **broker**.

The client may then present the updated availability and suitable **offers** to
the customer.

## Creating and updating orders

**Booking systems** MUST expose an **orders** endpoint, e.g. `/orders` to allow
**brokers** to initiate the **booking** workflow.

**Orders** initiated by a specific **broker** SHOULD only be able to be updated
by the same **broker**. For the purpose of creating and updating an **order**
the only reliable mechanism for ensuring that the **broker** is the same across
requests is via authentication/identification by API keys or Authoriztion
headers. The **broker** property within the **order** is for information only.

It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that only the
**broker** which created the **order** can update, complete and cancel an
order.

### Discovering the order endpoint

**Booking systems** MUST expose an orders endpoint, e.g. /orders to allow
**brokers** to initiate and enter the **booking** workflow.

To initiate the **booking workflow**, the **booking system** must include a
`potentialAction` field within each **bookable** **opportunity**. The
`potentialAction` field MUST contain one or more objects of type ReserveAction.

These ReserveAction objects must contain a `target` field containing an
EntryPoint object.

The EntryPoint object MUST state the `url` of the orders endpoint, and SHOULD
contain the `encodingType` and the `httpMethod` which must be POST as a new
**order** object will be created on successful invocation.

If the **offer** relates to a **slot** within a `FacilityUse`, the closest
`potentialAction` property matching the type `ReserveAction` should be used.

An example is below:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a ReserveAction">

"potentialAction": [
  {
    "type": "ReserveAction",
    "name": "Book",
    "target": {
      "type": "EntryPoint",
      "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/orders",
      "encodingType": "application/vnd.openactive.v1.0+json",
      "httpMethod": "POST"
    }
  }
]

</pre>




### Pre-conditions for creating an order

Before creating an **order** the **broker** MUST:

- have obtained **customer** information
- have determined that the **opportunity** is bookable (see sections on the
definition of bookable for events and slots/facility uses)
- have identified the selected **offer**
- have prompted **customer** that they will enter a **payment** flow
(no pre-emptive leasing)
- have indicates that the **customer's** personal information is being submitted
to third-party (the **booking system** and the **seller**) and made the customer
aware of and assent to any legitimate privacy policy and terms and conditions
- have already obtained permission to use API

Before creating an **order** the **broker** SHOULD:

- have registered the **customer** (or have the **customer's** details to hand)
- have identified the **customer's** preferred payment options

### Creating a new order (`/orders`)

A POST request to the `/orders` endpoint of the **booking system** will result
in server creating an new **Order**. A time limited lease will be created for
spaces in the **event** referenced in the **Order**.

The `broker` property in the request body is to help the **booking platform** to
clarify who is making request and to help them in situations such as queries
to allow reconciliation of payments. It is not designed as any part of an
authentication which should be performed outside of the JSON body of the
request. No authentication tokens should be present within the `broker` property
of the submitted JSON.

The `broker` property should be a well formed schema:Organisation object.

In the situation where a middleware to be used to handle access control for
various **brokers**, independently of API key provisioning at the
**booking system** level (which in some systems is a lengthly and time-consuming
process), the `broker` property should contain the details of the end-user
**broker** rather than the middleware.

To acheive compliance with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Google Reserve, the
customer's telephone number, an optional field, should be supplied.

### Deleting an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

A `DELETE` request to an **Order** URI will delete the order. Deletion may only
be used in the specific case for cancelling an **order** and the associated
lease on a space in an **event** if the **customer** no longer wishes to take
up the opportunity.

A `DELETE` request MUST NOT be used to cancel an existing completed **order**
as part of a refund/cancellation workflow. An appropriate approach for that is
defined elsewhere.

### Completing an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

An **order** is completed by the **broker** submitting notification that the
**customer** has made a payment via a third-party payment gateway.

An **order** is not considered complete until payment has occurred.

**Brokers** MUST update the **booking system** to indicate that **payment** has
been taken.

Once the **booking system** is content with the payments, it then sets the
`orderStatus` property of the `Order` to https://schema.org/OrderDelivered and
returns a representation of the completed **order** with a 200 status code.

## Ordering a place at a free event/ordering a free slot

Free **opportunities** MUST follow the same workflow as paid **opportunities**.
A free **event** or **slot** is technically a free **offer** on a space for an
opportunity. There MUST be at least one offer with a price property of `0.00`.
For free Offers publishers MAY leave out the priceCurrency. If a priceCurrency
is not available then brokers SHOULD display a suitable default currency when
displaying a zero price.

The **order** workflow MUST be followed as described for **offers** with a
payment. The PATCH to the URL defined in `PayAction` should follow the example
shown below.

**Orders** for a free place at an **opportunity** are the only current scenario
in the Booking API specification where a `Payment` object has `paymentMethod`
and `paymentMethodId` as optional properties.

## Leases and the orderLeaseDuration property

If the lease expires during **payment**, the **broker** MAY delete the **order**
(if the **booking system** has not already done so, returning a response with a
`410` status code).

The **broker** should then create a new **order** for the
**customer** in order to generate a new lease.

Before creating a new order, the **broker** MUST check the **opportunity** and
**offers** to ensure that a space still exists within the **opportunity**
and that the **offer** selected by the **customer** is still valid.

If no space exists or the **offer** is now invalid, the **customer**
should be refunded if payment has been taken.


## The state transitions during the order process

1. An **order** object is created by a **broker** invoking the orders endpoint
with a POST request containing details of the **broker** (represented as a
schema:Organisation), **customer** (represented as a schema:Person) and details
of the selected **event** and **offer** as components of a schema:OrderItem
object.
The **booking system** returns a representation of the **order** object to the
**broker** in a response with a 201 status and the URL for the object in the
`Location` header. The `orderStatus` of the **order** at this point in the flow
should be https://schema.org/OrderPaymentDue
2. Concurrently the **booking system** also creates a lease for a space in the
**event** for the **customer** for the duration specified in the
`orderLeaseDuration` property of the **event**.
3. The **broker** directs the customer into the flow of the third-party
**payment** provider.
4. If the **customer** successfully completes the payment within the duration
of the lease, the **broker** sends notification of the payment with a PATCH
request to the specific order end point (/orders/123 in the examples) with
details of the **payment** in the `paymentMethod` and `paymentMethodId`
properties. At this point the **order** is deemed to be completed. The
`orderStatus` property should be currently set to
`https://schema.org/OrderDelivered` and the `confirmationNumber`
property set to an appropriate unique value by the **booking system**. At this
point in the flow, the **order** is deemed to be complete.

If the lease expires before the payment is made, the **order** should either be
deleted by the **broker** or be deleted by the **booking system** at some point
after expiry. The `orderStatus` property should be set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled to indicate that the **order** cannot proceed
to completion.

## Actions which occur after order completion: confirmations and refunds

Both the **broker** and **booking system** may need to take further actions after
completing an order. This section describes some potential interactions.

### Supplying a confirmation to the customer

The **broker** SHOULD provide the **customer** with confirmation of a successful
payment having been made through the third-party system and that the **order**
has been completed successfully. The **broker** will have access to a completed
**order** which will contain a `confirmationCode` property.

The **booking system** may also provide the **customer** with a confirmation that
the space at the **opportunity** has been booked on their behalf.

### Refunding a customer and cancelling an order

Refunds and cancellations are a responsibility of the **broker** who is the
party in the system in a position to process a refund for the **customer** with
the third-party payments system.

The **broker** should initiate a refund with the third-party payment provider.
The refund process should be considered to be asynchronous for the purposes of
this specification.

After initiating a refund, the **broker** should cancel the
**order** by submitting a PATCH request to the URL defined in the `CancelAction`
prescribed in the `potentialAction` property of the **order** response.

The process of cancellation is documented in Section 5.6

## Customers

### Creation of customers on the booking system

In this current iteration of the Booking API specification, the programmatic
creation of **customers** on the **booking system** by the **broker** is
considered to be out of scope.

### Viewing a customer's previously placed orders

A server MUST provide endpoints to allow **brokers** to retrieve information
about previously placed **orders**. In future versions of the specification,
endpoints may be provided which permit a **broker** to see all **orders**
created by a **customer**. In this current implementation, if the **broker**
wishes to present a view of all **orders** for a **customer**, it should keep
an internal record.

### Deletion of personal data of the customer if the order is not completed

If an **order** is not completed, the **booking system** SHOULD delete all
personal information of the **customer** provided to it as part of the **order**
creation process.

# Future versions of this API

Some of the patterns within version 1.0, for example the PATCHing of an order
resource to provide a payment and using PATCH to change the status of an `orderItem` to
cancel an order provide the groundwork for known requirements such as multiple
order items (shopping carts), cancellation of individual order items and also
multipart payments.

Both `orderItems` and `payments` are modelled as collections to support
extension of the version 1.0 specification towards multipart orders and
payments without breaking changes in the Order model for subsequent versions.

The new models for Payment and for Error enhance the Open Active model
specification to make it more transactional when used as part of the Booking
API.

The currently known requirements not satisfied in version 1.0 are:

- multiple part orders
- supporting multiple payments
- customer creation
- managing of reservations
- support for member lookups

We have not yet decided what the priorities are, or whether all of these
requirements are in scope for version 1.0 and would encourage people to shape
future iterations of the specification by becoming involved in the communities
associated with Open Active and the open specification.

In a future version, it is imagined that an API method describing the service,
and including such things as the links to Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions
and the target for a ReserveAction could be used to reduce data duplication.
