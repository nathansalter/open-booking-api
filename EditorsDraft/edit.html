This document specifies an HTTP API for placing bookings to participate in
physical activities, either by attending events or through the use of leisure
or sports facilities.
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api/issues) and
pull requests. The source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).

        <div class="note">
This document represents an early Editors Draft of the planned API design. It is
likely to change between now and its final version. These
early drafts are intended to help developers provide that feedback by developing
proof-of-concept implementations. We encourage developers to explore this API and
contribute to the development of the specification.
        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="informative">
# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard
data models ([[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and
harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]).

This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to
be active. This specification builds on that work by defining an HTTP API that
can be implemented by booking systems that are publishing opportunity data. By
allowing third-party applications to place bookings in their systems, it becomes
 possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and
 sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
booking system (server) and the third-party application (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter.

## Scope and requirements

The current scope of the specification should conform to a set of
[use cases and requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsCr071V12i_2g0DK818OAGlEAJFLWwkBp9bpgx4fo8/edit?usp=sharing)
that have previously been identified and discussed with the OpenActive
community.

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest
use cases that will support making bookings on behalf of users. This core
functionality includes:

* __Pricing and availability__ – checking the price and current availabilty of
an event or for the use of a facility
* __Leasing__ – temporarily reserving spaces for a user to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst placing a booking
* __Booking__ – placing and viewing bookings, and where necessary, confirming
receipt of payment from users
* __Multiple order items__ - handling bookings for multiple events ("shopping carts") and for groups of users
* __Child booking__ - booking on behalf of a child

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and
facilities are currently out of scope:

* creating and managing accounts for users
* more complex pricing options, e.g. membership based pricing
* waiting lists for events

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community.

### Functionality that is out of scope

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive Community Group.

The functionality that is currently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ – while the specification recommends some
best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a
specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system
that offers the best security for their platform and users
* __Payment processing__ – the design assumes that all payment handling will
be carried out by the third-party application, in a separate payment flow.
Booking systems and application developers are able to use the payment and
reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their customers
* __API business models__ – the design is agnostic to any business models that
might govern the use of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing
fees
* __Discovery__  – finding, filtering and searching for opportunity data. This
specification assumes that the client and server applications have already
shared data about the relevant opportunities. Additional functionality in this
area will be addressed by future specifications from the Community Group

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

* Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a booking
system
* Software developers building client libraries or applications that will use
the API

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Key Actors

Of all the organisations and systems involved in a transaction, the API defined
by this specification is scoped tightly to only specify interactions between the **Broker** and
**Booking System**, with high level prompts for interactions with a **Payment Provider**.

# Booking Flow

## User Journey
The booking journey of a **Customer** is generalised into the following key steps:

1. **Select**: Customer selects an item
2. **Register / Login**: Customer enters personal details
3. **Book and Pay**: Customer enters payment details

Note that some or all steps may not actually be visible to the user if details are already known (e.g. known registration or payment details, or booking via voice command).

<figure>
 <img src="userjourney.png" alt="High level user journey">
 <figcaption>Illustration of the expected user journey.</figcaption>
</figure>


## High-level summary of the API

- **Broker** generates session [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) which it uses throughout the process.

- After both "**1. Select**" and "**2. Register / Login**", the **Broker** calls the **Booking System** to confirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. These calls are illustrated as checkpoints **C1** and **C2** on the diagram below.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", the **Broker** first _authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the payment provider), then confirms the booking with **Booking System** using an `Order` (**B** on the diagram below), and finally _captures_ the payment.

- The **Booking System** adds an `Order` to an RPDE feed specific to the **Broker**, which the **Broker** reads to update its internal state, generate Invoices, and deliver a notification to the Customer.

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflow.png" alt="High level booking flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow.</figcaption>
</figure>


### Broker contract with Booking System

To complete a successful booking journey:

- The **Broker** SHOULD call **C1** (without customer details)
- The **Broker** MUST call **C2** (with customer details), to retrieve the total order, with the exception of free orders where the order total is not required.
- The **Broker** MUST call **B** (with payment details)

If **B** fails, the **Broker** MUST cancel the payment without any consequence to the **Customer** or **Seller**.

### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The **Booking System** MUST respond to **C1** (without customer details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an indicative total order price, or a relevant error.
- The **Booking System** MUST respond to **C2** (with customer details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an exact total order price, or a relevant error.
- The **Booking System** MUST respond to **B** with a completed `Order`, or a relevant error. The whole booking succeeds or fails as one.

With the exception of leasing, **C1** and **C2** MUST NOT have any side effects.

### Leasing

In order to ensure that items cannot be "stolen" from a **Customer**'s shopping basket by another **Customer**, the use of leases are RECOMMENDED, however they are not required to ensure a low barrier of entry for implementers of the specification.

Individually at **C1** and **C2**, the **Booking System** can opt to create (or extend) a lease for the **Broker**. Whether they opt to do so may depend on the **Booking System**'s capability to support leases, or on the **Seller**'s configuration of the **Booking System**. At **C1** the lease is anonymous, at **C2** customer details are provided.

If a lease is created at **C1** and/or **C2** it is used during **B**, if not or if it had expired the booking completes anyway provided sufficient inventory is available.

The specification is designed to allow for leasing to be implemented at a later stage by a **Booking System** without affecting the **Broker**'s implementation.



## Step-by-step process description

<figure>
 <img src="sequencediagram.png" alt="Sequence diagram">
 <figcaption>Sequence diagram showing API interactions</figcaption>
</figure>

i) "**1. Select**" - User browses broker site anonymously and adds something to basket

  - **Broker** generates session UUID

ii) **C1** - **Broker** call with `OrderQuote` including UUID without a Person object to check availability and that the combination of items requested can be purchased (call is idempotent)

  - **Booking System** creates anonymous lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and totalPaymentDue confirmation. Response 200 indicates quote has been successfully produced (which implies all requested items are available). Response may include "orderLeaseExpiry" to indicate a lease has also been created against the UUID.
  - `OrderQuote` includes total pricing confirmation in response for basket to be updated, as well as enumerated orderedItems with their respective details that can be rendered by the **Broker** to ensure accuracy (rather than relying on syncing with the open feed).

iii) "**2. Register / Login**" - User clicks checkout and enters personal details

iv) **C2** - **Broker** call with `OrderQuote` including UUID with a Person object to check viability (call is idempotent)

  - Booking system creates named lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and totalPaymentDue confirmation. Works exactly as **C1**.

v) "**3. Book and Pay**" - User enters payment details and clicks Book

vi) **Authorise Payment** - **Broker** pre-authorises totalPaymentDue from payment provider, using UUID as a reference

vii) **B** - **Broker** call with `Order` including UUID with a Person object to check viability and with a Payment object for the total amount pre-authed (call is idempotent, can be retried if 500 returned).

  - If the total payment amount in the Payment object is different to the current totalPaymentDue (which might have changed since **C2**, e.g. if the headline price is changed in the booking system between these two steps), the booking fails but the lease is sustained so that the user can be prompted whether they want to continue with the new amount.

  - If some of the leases have expired, or if leases are not supported, then the booking system attempts to make the booking anyway. If there are no spaces available the booking fails.

  - If the booking succeeds only for some basket items, the whole transaction is rolled back and the entire booking fails.

  - If there's a failure, e.g. no response from server, then **Broker** can resubmit with same UUID. The Booking System will need to track UUID supplied by **Broker** against any successful orders, to ensure that it can update **Broker** on the order status if a previous request with that UUID was successful. **Broker** MUST NOT reuse UUIDs across multiple orders.

  - The booking is considered as complete and paid by the **Booking System** at this point

viii) **Capture Payment** - **Broker** captures totalPaymentDue from payment provider, using UUID as a reference

  - If an error occurs during capture (very unlikely but possible due to system failure), and this may only be noticed after the event due to server failure and observation of logs, the **Broker** must either:
    - Initiate manual capture via e.g. the Stripe console. Note the pre-auth will typically last for 7 days, so manual capture is still possible after the event.
    - Capture the payment from the user manually (MLP's preferred method, if manual capture not possible).
    - Absorb the loss and make a new payment for the same amount with the same UUID in the payment provider (better for UX / customer service, if manual capture not possible).
    - Send a cancellation request to the booking system and notify the **Customer** of the error in good time before the event.

 - It is the **Broker**'s responsibility to ensure that payment has been captured.

ix) **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification** - **Broker** retrieves the `Order`(s) that are generated by the **Booking System** on the RPDE feed, generates invoices, and sends **Customer** notifications

  - An secure RPDE feed of `Order`s MUST be provided by the **Booking System**, with the contents of the feed specific to the authenticating **Broker**. This allows the **Broker** to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of **Booking System**s, even when changes are made outside of the **Broker**. This also allows the **Broker** to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to **Customer**s in a consistent way.
  - The **Booking System** must ensure that the `Order`s in the RPDE feed represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system.
  - The **Broker** uses these `Order`s to generate invoices, and send notifications to the **Customer**.

# Broker Roles

A **Broker** is an actor that arranges transactions between a **Seller** and **Customer**, either directly or indirectly.

From a contractual and taxation perspective, there are two types of Broker, and agent (`AgentBroker`), and a reseller (`ResellerBroker`), as well direct purchase (`NoBroker`).

Note that this specification does not deal with contractual relationships, and simply provides a mechanism to record bookings.

## `ResellerBroker`

### Definition
A reseller is a company or individual that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them. This is usually done for profit (but could be resold at a loss).

### Contractual Relationships
In the context of OpenActive, a `ResellerBroker` contracts directly with the **Seller** as a business-to-business relationship to purchase access to the opportunity. It then, at a later point in time (which may only be milliseconds later), separately forms a contractual relationship with the **Customer**, who purchases access to the opportunity from the `ResellerBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="ResellerBroker.png" alt="ResellerBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in ResellerBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>


### Taxation
The `ResellerBroker`'s purchase from the **Seller** is business-to-business, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the **Customer**.
The **Customer**'s purchase from the `ResellerBroker` is business-to-consumer, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the **Seller**.

Hence any tax exception that the **Customer** may enjoy when purchasing directly from the **Seller** (e.g. if the **Seller** is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is not relevant here, as no direct contractual relationship is formed between **Seller** and **Customer**.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and **Seller**. It does include provision for the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and **Customer** explicitly, though it may be repurposed by the broker to perform this function by treating the Broker as a Booking system. This specification also does not include provision for the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.
When the brokerRole is set to `ResellerBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the "broker" specified in the Order.
Note that the `customer` may still optionally be included in the Order, for example to help front-of-house staff identify the **Customer**.

### Conformance criteria
When the booking system generates the Invoice in the response at B, the `Invoice.customer` property MUST be equal to `Order.broker`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` is optional.


##  `AgentBroker`

### Definition
An agent is authorized to act on behalf of another (the **Seller**, or "principle") to create legal relations with a third party (the **Customer**). Succinctly, it may be referred to as the equal relationship between a **Seller** and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under his or her control and on his or her behalf. The agent is required to negotiate on behalf of the principal (**Seller**) and/or bring them and third parties (**Customer**s) into contractual relationship.

### Contractual Relationships
There are three separate types of contractual relationship involved:
`AgentBroker` with **Seller**, known as the principal-agent relationship or "internal" relationship;
`AgentBroker` with **Customer** with whom they deal on their **Seller**'s behalf ("external relationship"); and
**Seller** with **Customer** when arranged by an `AgentBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="AgentBroker.png" alt="AgentBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in AgentBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
While facilitated by the `AgentBroker`, the primary purchase is made by the **Customer** directly from the **Seller**, as would be the case if the **Customer** was to purchase from the **Seller** independently.
Hence any tax exception that the **Customer** may enjoy when purchasing directly from the **Seller** (e.g. if the **Seller** is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is relevant here.

The **Customer**'s relationship with `AgentBroker` is business-to-consumer. Hence any additional services (e.g. customer-facing booking fees) are subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `AgentBroker` as the `seller`.

The `AgentBroker`'s relationship with the **Seller** is business-to-business. Hence any additional services (e.g. booking commission) are subject to the appropriate taxation.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the **Customer** and **Seller**.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship between the `AgentBroker` and the **Seller** (e.g. for booking commission), between the `AgentBroker` and the **Customer** (e.g. for booking fees) or with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships and the reconciliation of associated invoices MUST be handled separately.
When the brokerRole is set to "AgentBroker", this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the Order.

### Conformance criteria
When the booking system generates the Invoice, the `Invoice.customer` property MUST be equal to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

## `NoBroker`

### Definition
This specification supports direct purchase by a **Customer** (for example in the context of the **Seller**'s own website, or for businesses that purchase large volumes of FacilityUse slots to run leagues).

### Contractual Relationships
The contractual relationship is a simple one between the **Seller** and the **Customer**.

<figure>
 <img src="NoBroker.png" alt="NoBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in NoBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
The purchase is made by the **Customer** directly from the **Seller**, as would be the case if the **Customer** was to purchase from the **Seller** outside of this specification.
Hence any tax exception that the **Customer** may enjoy when purchasing directly from the **Seller** (e.g. if the **Seller** is an VAT exempt eligible body) is relevant here.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the **Customer** and **Seller**.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.

When the brokerRole is set to "NoBroker", this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the Order.

### Conformance criteria
When the booking system generates the Invoice, the `Invoice.customer` property MUST be equal to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST NOT be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

# Systems of Record


## Roles and responsibilities overview


For the purposes of this specification, the key components of a booking are: `Order`, **Invoice**, **Payment** and **Refund**.

The **Broker** has visibility of all components, while for simplicity of implementation the **Booking System** only has visibility of the `Order`, as shown below:

<figure>
 <img src="roles.png" alt="Roles and responsibilities">
 <figcaption>Roles and responsibilities</figcaption>
</figure>

`Order`s are the basis of the exchange between the **Booking System** and the **Broker**. This specification describes a detailed model and API to allow **Broker**s to manipulate `Order`s, and only high level functional requirements for the expected behaviour of **Invoice**s, **Payment**s, **Receipt**s.


| Component | Description | Owner | Audit |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| `Order` | A mutable object that encompasses the live state of the bookable `Event`s within the booking system. An `Order` has a `orderItem`s, a `totalPaymentDue`, and all tax details, but is not itself a legal representation of a purchase from the **Seller**. | **Booking System** | Mutable |
| **Invoice** | An immutable object that is a legal representation of the purchase, which MUST be rendered to the **Customer** as a legally permissible tax receipt, and exist as a tax point. A new **Invoice** MUST be generated for the `Order` to replace the previous **Invoice** each occasion that an `orderItem` within an `Order` is cancelled. | **Broker** | Immutable |
| **Payment** | A immutable object that represents the original payment to the **Seller** for the initial `Order`. Although modelling the **Payment** is outside the scope of this specification, it is recommended that one payment exists for each `Order`. | **Payment Provider** | Immutable |
| **Refund** | An immutable object that represents each refund made against the **Payment**, up to the **Payment**'s total amount | **Payment Provider** | Immutable |




## Invoices and Tax receipts

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the **Booking System** MUST NOT send receipts directly to the **Customer** for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful `Order` operation, the **Broker** MUST generate a new **Invoice** in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the `Order` RPDE feed contents. In order to ensure that the **Customer** is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` is provided in the `Order` upon completion of any operation, the **Broker** MUST generate a new or updated **Invoice** and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the **Invoice** to the **Customer** and/or (b) offer a means to allow the **Customer** to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the  **Invoice** at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the **Seller**'s responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the **Broker** is making tax information available to its customers in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the **Broker** MUST comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note by following specification, for all broker modes where a **Seller** may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the **Seller** will have the details of the **Customer** and the transaction enough to generate the most recent tax receipt.

## Payments and Refunds

Although the details of **Payment**s and **Refund**s are not in the scope of this specification, a single **Payment** MUST be related to each `Order`, and a unique reference to this **Payment** MUST be included in the `Payment` `identifier` of the `Order` sent to the **Booking System**. Note that this **Payment** is permitted to represent a virtual **Payment** consolidating a number of actual **Payments** to allow for a wide variety of **Payment** methods. In the case where the **Seller** is paid monthly, the **Payment** may also represent a reference to a future invoice against which the eventual **Payment** will be paid. In all cases the `Payment` `identifier` MUST be uniquely resolvable for audit purposes.

## Tax calculation

### B2C tax calculation by Booking System is mandatory

For `AgentBroker` and `NoBroker` modes, where the customer is of type `Person` and a tax receipt is usually generated by the **Booking System**, the tax calculation and associated properties this specification MUST be implemented by the **Booking System** (even if the resulting tax amount is zero).

### B2B tax calculation by Booking System is optional

Tax calculation at the **Booking System** is OPTIONAL when the `brokerRole` of `ResellerBroker` is specified, or when a customer of type `Organization` is specified. If tax calculation is not supported for a `ResellerBroker`, `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` MUST NOT be included, and the `taxMode` `https://openactive/TaxNet` MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote` (i.e. explicitly not including tax calculation). This applies to both `OrderQuote` and to the final `Order`.

This allows tax to be calculated by the `ResellerBroker` or business **Customer** and reconciled outside of this specification.

## Tax mode

The `taxMode` (`https://openactive/TaxNet` or `https://openactive/TaxGross`) is specified at the **Seller** level, and must be consistent for all `Order`s originating from that **Seller**.



## Offer overrides

The unit price of an OrderItem may be overridden to allow for business models with dynamic or variable pricing.

An `OfferOverride` type may be supplied to the `acceptedOffer` property at **C1**, **C2** and **B**. When an `OfferOverride` is used, it must be used consistently between **C2** and **B** to OrderQuote, it must be used by the booking system instead of acceptedOffer to calculate the tax and totals.

The `unitTaxSpecification` is calculated by the booking system exactly as it would be for an standard `Offer`. The `price` of the `OfferOverride` may be zero, and also may be higher or lower than the available `Offer`s that exist in the **Booking System**.

`OfferOverride` MUST NOT be used when `isAccessibleForFree` is `true`, as free events cannot be overridden. Note that booking systems that only offer free opportunities MUST NOT implement `OfferOverride` support, and must always throw an error when it is used.

<pre class="example" title="Example of OfferOverride">
  "acceptedOffer": {
    "type": "OfferOverride",
    "description": "Winger space for Speedball.",
    "name": "Speedball winger position",
    "price": 10.00,
    "priceCurrency": "GBP"
  }
</pre>

# Order Operations

## Amending the OrderQuote before **B**

The **Broker** MAY call **C1** and MUST call **C2** when the **Customer** updates their basket to add and remove items.

When repeated calls to **C1** or **C2** are made with the same UUID, the **Booking System** MUST expire the leases of items that have been removed from the basket.

All leases may be cancelled by submitting an `OrderQuote` with the same UUID but without any `orderItem`s as either **C1** or **C2**. The **Broker** SHOULD make a reasonable attempt to cancel all leases when it is aware that a **Customer** has abandoned their journey. For **Booking Systems** that have not implemented leasing, an `OrderQuote` without any `orderItem`s can simply be ignored.

## Cancellation after **B**

Either the whole `Order` or individual `OrderItem`s within the `Order` may be cancelled after **B**, however `OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification.

The cancellation may be requested by either the **Customer** or the **Seller**, and results in an updated `Order` item on the RPDE feed. Once a cancellation status is placed on an `OrderItem` within an `Order` in the RPDE feed it is assumed by the **Booking System** to have been processed, and it MUST NOT be reversed. A new `Order` will need to created to reinstate the booking.

### Customer requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="customercancelled.png" alt="Customer requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Customer requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

To cancel an existing OrderItem, the **Broker** MUST:

1. Use the latest state of the `Order` from the RPDE feed to determine which `OrderItem`s may be cancelled. If `allowSimpleCancellation` is `true`, a PATCH against the `OrderItem` `id` with a body of `{ "orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled" }` MUST succeed. The value of the refund for each `OrderItem` MUST be equal to the sum of the `price` in the `acceptedOffer` and the price in the `unitTaxSpecification`, which allows the **Customer** to be informed of the expected refund before they commit to cancellation.

2. For each `OrderItem` to be cancelled, a PATCH must be submitted using the URI `id` of the `OrderItem` from the feed with a body of `{ "orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled" }`. On success, a 204 response will be received, without any body. On failure a 5xx response will be received with an error message.

3. Process any refunds based on the resulting updates to the RPDE feed. Successfully cancelled `OrderItems` will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled`. Note refunds MUST NOT be processed except in response to updates in the RPDE feed.

To cancel an entire `Order`, a PATCH request must be made to each `OrderItem` within it individually. To minimise the number of updates in the RPDE feed, it is recommended that multiple DELETEs are sent in quick succession.

<div class="issue" data-number="92"></div>

### Seller requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="sellercancelled.png" alt="Seller requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Seller requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderItems` cancelled by the Seller will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` in the RPDE feed, and refunds MUST be processed in response to the RPDE updates.



## Notifications, updates and refunds

An secure RPDE feed of `Order`s MUST be provided by the **Booking System**, with the contents of the feed specific to the authenticating **Broker**. This allows the **Broker** to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of **Booking System**s, even when changes are made outside of the **Broker**.

This also allows the **Broker** to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to **Customer**s in a consistent way.

### Booking System: Updating RPDE `Order`s

The **Booking System** must ensure that the `Order`s in the RPDE feed represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system.

In order to allow a natural batching of updates in the RPDE feed, where multiple cancellations may be made across multiple `Order`s for the same **Customer**, cancellation updates made to `Order`s in the feed by the **Booking System** MUST be posted with a modified date 30 seconds into the future. The following query will easily exclude such updates while still meeting the RPDE specification:

<pre class="example sql" title="Example of RPDE query with natural batching">
  --include first part of WHERE clause only if @afterTimestamp and @afterId provided
     WHERE (
          (modified = @afterTimestamp
                AND id > @afterId)
          OR (modified > @afterTimestamp)
        )
        AND modified <= GETDATE()
  ORDER BY modified,
           id
</pre>

### Broker: Processing RPDE `Order`s

The **Broker** MUST maintain an up-to-date store of `Order`s received from the **Booking System**. Each `Order` received is compared to the last `Order` stored, and any differences between the old and new content trigger notifications and refunds to the **Customer**, as well as updating the **Broker**'s store.

Hence it is important for the **Broker** to consider their store of `Order`s as durable, and not simply a cache, to ensure their customers always get relevant notifications.


### New `Orders`

New (unrecognised) `Order` items in the RPDE feed may be used to notify the **Customer** with a VAT receipt, but MUST be stored by the **Broker**.


### Cancellation, refund calculation and notification

Regardless of the source of the cancellation, the process for refunding and notifying the **Customer** and updating the **Broker**'s records is exactly the same.

The **Broker** MUST process refunds for each new cancellation found in the feed, and it is the **Broker**'s responsibility to continually retry failed refund processing and escalate any processing failure to the **Customer** accordingly. Note that the RPDE feed is "fire and forget" for the **Booking System**: once an `OrderItem` is updated with a cancellation status in the RPDE feed, the status MUST not be reversed, and is assumed by the **Booking System** to be processed.

For items found with `OrderItem`s that contain `orderItemStatus` with new `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled` or `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` values, the new `totalPaymentDue` value of the `Order` must be made to equal the value of the associated **Payment** less any **Refund**s, by creating an additional **Refund**s if necessary. Cancellation fees may be added to the `Order` for each cancellation, so the refund may not be equal to the original amount.

The **Customer** MUST be notified after a refund is successfully processed, using the `orderItemStatus` to indicate the source of the cancellation.

If refund processing takes longer than 15 minutes, and a new status of `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` was detected by the **Broker**, then the **Customer** must be notified immediately of a cancellation ahead of the notification of the completed refund. This ensures the **Seller** can rely on the **Broker** as a notification channel in the event of cancellation.

Note that the **Customer** MUST be notified in the event of all cancellations, even if no refund is due.

            "name": "AcmeBroker Points", // optional free text description of payment method for booking system, to help the Seller in discussions with the Customer (e.g. "AcmeBroker Points" or "AcmeBroker via Credit Card")
            "identifier": "1234567890npduy2f"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```



## Amending the Order after **B**

`OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification. A new `Order` must be created, and the old `Order` cancelled.

For the common case of rescheduling a `SessionSeries` or `FacilityUse` booking, the following steps are recommended for the **Broker**:

1. Request an `OrderQuote` for the new `orderItem`s with a new UUID, using **C2**.

2. Check the latest stored state of `Order`s from the RPDE feed to ensure that old `orderItem` `allowSimpleCancellation`.

3. Clearly display messaging to the **Customer** that explains that this transaction will involve a refund and new purchase, and so they will expect a refund for the old item and a new transaction for the new one. Information should be displayed to the **Customer** if any price difference exists between the two Orders, for the **Customer** to confirm.

4. Request new payment details from the **Customer** and Authorise the amount specified by **C2**, then DELETE the old `orderItem`, and if successful, complete **B** as normal.

The new `Order` is completed as described in the new booking process, and the existing `Order` is cancelled with the refund processed as described in the next section.


## Extension points for including Payments

In some limited circumstances it might also be desirable for an Open Booking API to act as a facade over a Booking System, Payment Processor, and Invoicing systems. For these circumstances the specification allows the API defined here to be extended via additional OPTIONAL properties in the `Payment` type used in `B` in a custom namespace, to facilitate a full payment.

<pre class="example" title="Example of Payment extension point">
  "payment": {
    "type": "Payment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "paymentMethod": "stripe:StripePayment",
    "stripe:token": "tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf"
  },
</pre>

Note that due to the variety of business models available in the OpenActive ecosystem, conformance to this specification requires that the use of any native payment functionality in the **Booking System** be optional, and the **Booking System** must always accept a lack of `paymentMethod` as indication of an external **Payment Processor** being used. To maximise flexibility of this extension point, `identifier` and `name` within `Payment` are NOT REQUIRED if `paymentMethod` is specified.


## Delivery of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy

The **Broker** MUST make the **Customer** aware of and assent to any `termsOfService`
provided within the `seller`, `broker`, and `bookingService` (which may include
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy) before the **Customer** completes **B**.

Since, during booking, the details of the **Customer** are provided to the
**Booking System** and the **Seller**, the **Broker** SHOULD inform the
**Customer** of this any implications with respect to GDPR and any other
data protection legislation.

Note that `termsOfService` may only be specified at the `seller`, `broker` or
`bookingService` level, and may not be provided for a specific `Offer` or `OrderItem`.

<pre class="example" title="Properties for Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy">
  "termsOfService": [
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Privacy Policy"
      "url": "https://example.com/privacy-policy",
    },
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Terms and Conditions"
      "url": "https://example.com/terms-and-conditions",
    }
  ]
</pre>

The URLs in the example are only illustrative.

# Endpoints

This API has been defined around the concept of URL discovery. This
allows resource URLs which match the naming conventions of each **Booking System**.

# Paths and Verbs

Due to URL discovery, the paths of the endpoints below are illustrative, as the actual paths may vary provided they are consistent within an implementation.

A summary of endpoints defined by this specification is provided below:

| Name                   | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Creation         | REQUIRED    | Order collection | POST      | `/orders`                                        |
| Orders RPDE Feed       | REQUIRED    | RPDE feed        | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                                   |
| OrderItem Cancellation | REQUIRED    | OrderItem        | PATCH     | `/orders/{order-id}/order-items/{order-item-id}` |
| Order Cancellation     | RECOMMENDED | Order            | PATCH     | `/orders/{order-id}`                             |
| Order Status           | OPTIONAL    | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{order-id}`                             |

# URL discovery

The URL for the initial Order Creation action may be discovered by parsing the
`OpenBookingAction` defined in the `potentialAction` property of the published
`Dataset` embedded within dataset site.

<pre class="example" title="Example of a potentialAction">
  "potentialAction": [
    {
      "@type": "OpenBookingAction",
      "target": {
        "@type": "EntryPoint",
        "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/api/orders",
        "encodingType": ["application/vnd.openactive+jsonld; model=2.0, booking=1.0"],
        "httpMethod": "POST"
      },
      "supportingData": {
        "@type": "DataFeed",
        "distribution": [
          {
              "@type": "DataDownload",
              "name": "Order",
              "additionalType": "https://schema.org/Order",
              "encodingFormat": ["application/vnd.openactive+json; model=2.0, booking=1.0, rpde=1.0"],
              "contentUrl": "https://example.com/api/feeds/offers"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
</pre>

Since discovery of URLs is an implicit part of the specification, **Brokers**
SHOULD avoid hard-coding URLs for specific actions into their applications and
client libraries. **Brokers**  SHOULD use most applicable URL discovered at the
point in the workflow they are currently in - e.g. not use a cached URL that has
been previously successfully used. They should also not attempt to create URLs
for a specific action based on patterns within previously used URLs.

It is the responsibility of **Booking Systems** to advertise the URL for
further activity in the booking workflow at the point of need. For example they
MUST advertise the URL for the `OrderItem` resource in the Orders RPDE Feed feed
by including the `id` property.

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Media types


Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive, and for **Booking Systems** to stipulate which versions
of the specification they support.

**Booking Systems** MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types will conform to the following pattern:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=[m], booking=[b], rpde=[r]
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=2.0, booking=1.0, rpde=1.0
```

**Brokers** specifying a media type without a version, such as:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json
```

will receive data in in the most current format.

If you are building an application as a **Broker** and care about the stability
of the response, or have a client application which is tied to a specific
version you should always try to use a media type containing the version number.


<div class="issue" data-number="93"></div>


## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents, with the exception of RPDE feeds, where only documents
included in the `data` property are valid [[!JSON-LD]].

The [[!JSON-LD]] documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers
to the [[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.


## Error handling

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP
5XX status code.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format using a
content type of `application/vnd.openactive+json` and include at least one
Error object. The error handling has in the Booking API has been modelled
closely on [[!RFC7807]].

<pre class="example" title="Error response format">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
  "type": "Error",
  "errorType": "https://openactive.io/errors/incomplete_customer_details",
  "title": "Incomplete customer details",
  "details": "No customer details supplied",
  "status": 400,
  "instance": "/orders",
  "method": "POST"
}
</pre>

* `errorType` – a URI reference [[!RFC3986]] that identifies the problem type. This
specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide human-readable
documentation for the problem type.
When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be "about:blank".
* `title` – a short, human-readable summary of the problem type. It
SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
purposes of localization.
* `description` – a slightly longer, human-readable summary of the problem type.
It largely SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem,
except for purposes of localization or to provide specific information about why
the error occurred in that particular case.
* `status`  – the HTTP status code ([[!RFC7231]], Section 6) generated by the
origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
* `instance`  – a URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
the problem. It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
* `requestId`  – used by technical support for diagnostics purposes.

## Security

All HTTP requests and responses SHOULD be secured using SSL.

## Authentication

### API level authentication

All of the API transactions described in this document SHOULD require
authentication.

This standard does not mandate a particular authentication method, but
recommendation is that implementers SHOULD consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is
well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different
application flows (e.g. via a Javascript web application or between servers).

Other server to server authentication mechanisms such as basic authentication,
API key or bearer tokern based mechanisms are also appropriate.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that **orders**
created by a specific **broker** SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other
**broker**. It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that
subsequent requests to an `Order` should only be initiated by the **broker**
which created the `Order`.

### Customer level authentication

Where necessary, OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) provides a standard
way of verifying the identity of customer. It is a thin layer that sits
atop OAuth2.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that **orders**
created by a specific **customer** SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other
**customer**. It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that
subsequent requests to an `Order` should only be initiated by the **customer**
which created the `Order`.

# Operations

## Checking availability and offers

This specification assumes that a *broker* has already obtained opportunity
data from a *booking system* that includes descriptions of **events**,
**facilities**, **slots** etc. For example by harvesting data via an [[RPDE]]
feed.

The availability of an **event**, or `subEvent`, or **facility** (either as a
`FacilityUse` or `Slot`) may change at any time.

The **offers** available to a customer might also change over time and the data
should be refreshed so that the most up-to-date representation of the live data
is presented to the **purchaser** before booking.

A **booking system**  MUST allow a **broker** to check the current state of
**events** and/or **facilities** depending on what decide they expose from their
platform.

### Definition of a 'bookable' Event

An **event** is deemed to be 'bookable' if:

- The **event** has not already occurred, i.e. the `startDate` (when expressed
as a timedatestamp) and the `endDate` of the **event** has not been exceeded

- The `eventStatus` of the **event** does not indicate that it has been
cancelled or postponed

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of the **event** is greater than the number
of places required

- The `potentialAction` of the **event** contains one or more appropriate
ReserveAction objects

- There are one or more valid bookable **offers** for the **event**

- The temporary lease on the space in the **event** (defined in
`orderLeaseDuration`) has not expired before the **payment** is taken
by the **broker** and the **seller** is notified by the **broker** that payment
has taken place.

The **customer** may be ineligible to attend a 'bookable' **event**, but may
book a space for someone else (e.g. a child) if:

- The gender of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with
the `genderRestriction` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

- The age of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with the
`ageRange` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

The **event** may also be deemed to be bookable if the **event** contains a deep
link to a URL where the user can book the **event** independently, however
this is out of scope for this API

The above set of restrictions are at the level of the **event** and the data
contained within the content of the API returns.

On a **booking system** level, an **event** is 'bookable', mediated by a
specific **broker**, if that **broker** has machine readable permission to
access the relevant instance of the Booking API provided by the **booking**
system via an API key or similar token.

For the purposes of this specification, the **event** is only bookable if the
data describing the the **event** is published via a **booking system** which
is compliant with and supports the Open Active Booking API.


### Definition of a 'bookable' slot/facility use

A slot is essentially an event, and many of the above conditions apply, however
some of the properties for a slot are different and as a consequence there are
different criteria for it being bookable.

A **slot** is deemed to be 'bookable' if:

- The **slot** has not already occurred, i.e. the `startDate` (when expressed
as a timedatestamp) and `endDate` of the **slot** has not been exceeded

- The `remainingUses` of the **slot** is greater than or equal to the number
of slots required. For example if an independently organised badminton league
requires four courts, the number of `remainingUses` should be 4 or higher.

- There are one or more valid **offers** for the slot

- The `potentialAction` of the **slot** contains one or more appropriate
ReserveAction objects

There may be more restrictions placed by a **seller** on the booking of a
**slot** for use of a **facility**. For example, it may be that one of the party
must be over a certain age as a supervising adult if some of the party are
minors. It is the responsibility of the **booking platform** to make the terms
and conditions of **booking** available to the **broker** and it is the
responsibility of the **broker** to ensure that the **customer** is aware of
these conditions before entering the `Order` workflow.

### Checking availability and offers for an event or facility use slot

To check the availability of an opportunity a **broker** will send a GET
request to the URI specified in the `id` of the opportunity, having
discovered it from the RDPE feed.

It is the responsibility of **brokers** to ensure that spaces within the
opportunity are still available before proceeding with booking.

### Assembling a set of offers and presenting them to a customer

The **broker** MUST assemble a set of all applicable **offers** for an
**opportunity** from the information supplied by the **booking system**.
An applicable **offer** is an **offer** which is available for an
**opportunity** which is bookable and for which the **customer** is eligible.

#### Collating offers for an event

In the case of the **event** having no `subEvent` the set of all applicable
**offers** is simply the array of **offers** contained within the `offers`
property.

In the case of an **event** containing sub-events within the `subEvent` property
the set of all applicable offers should be compiled from the **offers** from the
sub-event selected by the customer, augmented with any additional different
offers contained in the parent super-event.

If the sub-event selected by the **customer** has no **offers** the set of all
applicable offers will be compiled from the **offers** contained withinin the
super-event.

The **broker** should then filter this set to provide a set of current **offers**
which apply to the **customer**. This specification provides no guidance as to
how the filtering should be performed.

The **broker** SHOULD however show all applicable **offers** to a customer,
including information on pricing restrictions, unless the **customer** has only
requested a subset in some form of preferences (e.g. only show adult classes
and offers).

The **customer** selects one of these **offers** and when all pre-conditions
have been met, the **broker** enters the `Order` creation workflow on behalf
of the customer.

#### Collating offers for the use of a facility

The process for building a set of all applicable offers is similar for
**facilities** with the **offers** which are part of a specific **slot** having
primacy over the more generic **offers** contained within a`FacilityUse`.

The **booking system** MUST ensure that the data presented to the **broker** in
the `remainingUses` property  in the **slot** is up to date and includes a
combination of places already booked and places currently reserved by leases
from in-progress **orders**. The **booking system** MUST also ensure that
the `hoursAvailable` property on the `FacilityUse` is kept updated.


### Obtaining a lease on a space within an opportunity

**Orders** SHOULD contain a `orderLeaseDuration` property. This
property MUST contain an ISO 8601 formatted duration for the lease. The lease
duration may also be advertised somewhere else to make it clear in advance,
e.g. in docs/setup config, or as part of a `potentialAction` property.

(Note: In previous iterations of the Booking API specification, the lease was
a property of an event. This has now been deprecated.)

The `orderLeaseDuration` property notifies the **broker** about the
length of time for which a space will be reserved by the **booking system**
whilst payment for the **event** is taken by the third-party payment system.

The default suggested lease duration is 15 minutes, but it is up to each
**booking plaftorm** to define and advertise their own lease duration.

This lease is NOT designed as a pause for a shopping cart system (in addition
shopping cart functionality is out of scope for v1.0 of this specification).

The **broker** MUST ensure that it has obtained all of the relevant details
about a **customer** before getting to the point where it attempts to place an
`Order`. The lease is not designed as a pause in the process whilst a
**customer** is registered by a **broker**.

The client may then present the updated availability and suitable **offers** to
the customer.

## Creating and updating orders

**Booking systems** MUST expose an **orders** endpoint, e.g. `/orders` to allow
**brokers** to initiate the **booking** workflow.

**Orders** initiated by a specific **broker** SHOULD only be able to be updated
by the same **broker**. For the purpose of creating and updating an `Order`
the only reliable mechanism for ensuring that the **broker** is the same across
requests is via authentication/identification by API keys or Authoriztion
headers. The **broker** property within the `Order` is for information only.

It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that only the
**broker** which created the `Order` can update, complete and cancel an
order.

### Discovering the order endpoint

**Booking systems** MUST expose an orders endpoint, e.g. /orders to allow
**brokers** to initiate and enter the **booking** workflow.

To initiate the **booking workflow**, the **booking system** must include a
`potentialAction` field within each **bookable** **opportunity**. The
`potentialAction` field MUST contain one or more objects of type ReserveAction.

These ReserveAction objects must contain a `target` field containing an
EntryPoint object.

The EntryPoint object MUST state the `url` of the orders endpoint, and SHOULD
contain the `encodingType` and the `httpMethod` which must be POST as a new
`Order` object will be created on successful invocation.

If the **offer** relates to a **slot** within a `FacilityUse`, the closest
`potentialAction` property matching the type `ReserveAction` should be used.

An example is below:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a ReserveAction">

"potentialAction": [
  {
    "type": "ReserveAction",
    "name": "Book",
    "target": {
      "type": "EntryPoint",
      "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/orders",
      "encodingType": "application/vnd.openactive.v1.0+json",
      "httpMethod": "POST"
    }
  }
]

</pre>




### Pre-conditions for creating an order

Before creating an `Order` the **broker** MUST:

- have obtained **customer** information
- have determined that the **opportunity** is bookable (see sections on the
definition of bookable for events and slots/facility uses)
- have identified the selected **offer**
- have prompted **customer** that they will enter a **payment** flow
(no pre-emptive leasing)
- have indicates that the **customer's** personal information is being submitted
to third-party (the **booking system** and the **seller**) and made the customer
aware of and assent to any legitimate privacy policy and terms and conditions
- have already obtained permission to use API

Before creating an `Order` the **broker** SHOULD:

- have registered the **customer** (or have the **customer's** details to hand)
- have identified the **customer's** preferred payment options

### Creating a new order (`/orders`)

A POST request to the `/orders` endpoint of the **booking system** will result
in server creating an new `Order`. A time limited lease will be created for
spaces in the **event** referenced in the `Order`.

The `broker` property in the request body is to help the **booking platform** to
clarify who is making request and to help them in situations such as queries
to allow reconciliation of payments. It is not designed as any part of an
authentication which should be performed outside of the JSON body of the
request. No authentication tokens should be present within the `broker` property
of the submitted JSON.

The `broker` property should be a well formed schema:Organisation object.

In the situation where a middleware to be used to handle access control for
various **brokers**, independently of API key provisioning at the
**booking system** level (which in some systems is a lengthly and time-consuming
process), the `broker` property should contain the details of the end-user
**broker** rather than the middleware.

To acheive compliance with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Google Reserve, the
customer's telephone number, an optional field, should be supplied.

    }
  ]
}

</pre>

Note: The `paymentDueDate` is set by the date and time of the `Order` and the
`orderLeaseDuration`.

### Deleting an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

A `DELETE` request to an `Order` URI will delete the order. Deletion may only
be used in the specific case for cancelling an `Order` and the associated
lease on a space in an **event** if the **customer** no longer wishes to take
up the opportunity.

A `DELETE` request MUST NOT be used to cancel an existing completed `Order`
as part of a refund/cancellation workflow. An appropriate approach for that is
defined elsewhere.

### Completing an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

An `Order` is completed by the **broker** submitting notification that the
**customer** has made a payment via a third-party payment gateway.

An `Order` is not considered complete until payment has occurred.

**Brokers** MUST update the **booking system** to indicate that **payment** has
been taken.

Once the **booking system** is content with the payments, it then sets the
`orderStatus` property of the `Order` to https://schema.org/OrderDelivered and
returns a representation of the completed `Order` with a 200 status code.

      "httpMethod": "PATCH"
    }
  }]
}

</pre>

Note: If the record had been retrieved after the expiry of the cancellation window,
the `CancelAction` would be omitted.

## Ordering a place at a free event/ordering a free slot

Free **opportunities** MUST follow the same workflow as paid **opportunities**.
A free **event** or **slot** is technically a free **offer** on a space for an
opportunity. There MUST be at least one offer with a price property of `0.00`.
For free Offers publishers MAY leave out the priceCurrency. If a priceCurrency
is not available then brokers SHOULD display a suitable default currency when
displaying a zero price.

The `Order` workflow MUST be followed as described for **offers** with a
payment. The PATCH to the URL defined in `PayAction` should follow the example
shown below.

**Orders** for a free place at an **opportunity** are the only current scenario
in the Booking API specification where a `Payment` object has `paymentMethod`
and `paymentMethodId` as optional properties.

<pre class="example" title="Completing an free order with a payment of 0.00 - request">
PATCH /orders/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Date: Mon, 8 Oct 2018 20:51:35 GMT
Accept: application/vnd.openactive.v1.0+json

{
  "type": "Order",
  "payments": [{
    "type": "Payment",
    "totalPaidToProvider": {
      "type": "MonetaryAmount",
      "value": 0.00,
      "currency": "GBP"
    }
  }]
}

</pre>

## Leases and the orderLeaseDuration property

If the lease expires during **payment**, the **broker** MAY delete the `Order`
(if the **booking system** has not already done so, returning a response with a
`410` status code).

The **broker** should then create a new `Order` for the
**customer** in order to generate a new lease.

Before creating a new order, the **broker** MUST check the **opportunity** and
**offers** to ensure that a space still exists within the **opportunity**
and that the **offer** selected by the **customer** is still valid.

If no space exists or the **offer** is now invalid, the **customer**
should be refunded if payment has been taken.


## The state transitions during the order process

1. An `Order` object is created by a **broker** invoking the orders endpoint
with a POST request containing details of the **broker** (represented as a
schema:Organisation), **customer** (represented as a schema:Person) and details
of the selected **event** and **offer** as components of a schema:OrderItem
object.
The **booking system** returns a representation of the `Order` object to the
**broker** in a response with a 201 status and the URL for the object in the
`Location` header. The `orderStatus` of the `Order` at this point in the flow
should be https://schema.org/OrderPaymentDue
2. Concurrently the **booking system** also creates a lease for a space in the
**event** for the **customer** for the duration specified in the
`orderLeaseDuration` property of the **event**.
3. The **broker** directs the customer into the flow of the third-party
**payment** provider.
4. If the **customer** successfully completes the payment within the duration
of the lease, the **broker** sends notification of the payment with a PATCH
request to the specific order end point (/orders/123 in the examples) with
details of the **payment** in the `paymentMethod` and `paymentMethodId`
properties. At this point the `Order` is deemed to be completed. The
`orderStatus` property should be currently set to
`https://schema.org/OrderDelivered` and the `confirmationNumber`
property set to an appropriate unique value by the **booking system**. At this
point in the flow, the `Order` is deemed to be complete.

If the lease expires before the payment is made, the `Order` should either be
deleted by the **broker** or be deleted by the **booking system** at some point
after expiry. The `orderStatus` property should be set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled to indicate that the `Order` cannot proceed
to completion.

## Actions which occur after order completion: confirmations and refunds

Both the **broker** and **booking system** may need to take further actions after
completing an order. This section describes some potential interactions.

### Supplying a confirmation to the customer

The **broker** SHOULD provide the **customer** with confirmation of a successful
payment having been made through the third-party system and that the `Order`
has been completed successfully. The **broker** will have access to a completed
`Order` which will contain a `confirmationCode` property.

The **booking system** may also provide the **customer** with a confirmation that
the space at the **opportunity** has been booked on their behalf.

### Refunding a customer and cancelling an order

Refunds and cancellations are a responsibility of the **broker** who is the
party in the system in a position to process a refund for the **customer** with
the third-party payments system.

The **broker** should initiate a refund with the third-party payment provider.
The refund process should be considered to be asynchronous for the purposes of
this specification.

After initiating a refund, the **broker** should cancel the
`Order` by submitting a PATCH request to the URL defined in the `CancelAction`
prescribed in the `potentialAction` property of the `Order` response.

The process of cancellation is documented in Section 5.6

## Customers

### Creation of customers on the booking system

In this current iteration of the Booking API specification, the programmatic
creation of **customers** on the **booking system** by the **broker** is
considered to be out of scope.

### Viewing a customer's previously placed orders

A server MUST provide endpoints to allow **brokers** to retrieve information
about previously placed **orders**. In future versions of the specification,
endpoints may be provided which permit a **broker** to see all **orders**
created by a **customer**. In this current implementation, if the **broker**
wishes to present a view of all **orders** for a **customer**, it should keep
an internal record.

### Deletion of personal data of the customer if the order is not completed

If an `Order` is not completed, the **booking system** SHOULD delete all
personal information of the **customer** provided to it as part of the `Order`
creation process.

<section class="normative">

# Future versions of this API

Some of the patterns within version 1.0, for example the PATCHing of an order
resource to provide a payment and using PATCH to change the status of an `orderItem` to
cancel an order provide the groundwork for known requirements such as multiple
order items (shopping carts), cancellation of individual order items and also
multipart payments.

Both `orderItems` and `payments` are modelled as collections to support
extension of the version 1.0 specification towards multipart orders and
payments without breaking changes in the Order model for subsequent versions.

The new models for Payment and for Error enhance the Open Active model
specification to make it more transactional when used as part of the Booking
API.

The currently known requirements not satisfied in version 1.0 are:

- multiple part orders
- supporting multiple payments
- customer creation
- managing of reservations
- support for member lookups

We have not yet decided what the priorities are, or whether all of these
requirements are in scope for version 1.0 and would encourage people to shape
future iterations of the specification by becoming involved in the communities
associated with Open Active and the open specification.

In a future version, it is imagined that an API method describing the service,
and including such things as the links to Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions
and the target for a ReserveAction could be used to reduce data duplication.

At the moment there is no provision for a **customer** to cancel an `Order`
after the cancellation window, yet they may wish to do this out of politeness,
even though no refund is possible, with the benefit that their place may be
taken by another participant.
